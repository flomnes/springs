# springs
Simulate springs attached to masses in 2D. This is a quick & dirty simulator whose main purpose is to demonstrate the non-linear nature of systems with N springs whenever N>1.

# Results
## 4 springs, 1 mass
![Four springs](https://github.com/flomnes/springs/blob/master/out/1m4s.png)

## 3 masses attached with springs
